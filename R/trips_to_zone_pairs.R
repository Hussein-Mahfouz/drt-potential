#' Identify which OD pairs are served by each trip
#'
#' this function is used to identify all OD pairs that can be served directly by
#' each trip in the gtfs feed. It uses the \code{gtfs_trips_zone_coverage} and
#' the \code{generate_ordered_pairs} functions defined below.
#'
#'
#' @param gtfs a gtfs feed with a frequencies.txt file
#' @param zones a zonal sf layer of our study area
#' @param zone_column the column with the zone_id
#'
#' @return a dataframe with one row for each od pair served by a trip. The row has trip_id, start_time, headway_sec, Origin, Destination
#' @examples

# ---------- Function 1: Identify which zones are served by each trip

#' Identify which zones are served by each trip
#'
#' # each trip passes through a number of zones. We want a list of these zones. We do this by:
#'  a) identifying the stops associated with each trip
#'  b) doing a spatial join between stops and zones and using that to match trips to zones
#'
#'  This gives us a spatial df that has, for each trip, the unique stops that serve
#'  it and the zone that the stop falls in
#'
#' @param gtfs: a gtfs feed
#' @param zones: a zonal sf layer of our study area
#'
#' @return a dataframe with the trip_id and data on the intersected zones. The df has one row for each zone that a trip intersects
#' @examples
#'
#' @export
gtfs_trips_zone_coverage = function(gtfs, zones){
  # get stop geometry
  gtfs_stops <- gtfstools::convert_stops_to_sf(gtfs, crs = st_crs(zones))

  # --- identify which zone each stop is in
  gtfs_stops_int <- st_join(gtfs_stops, zones,
                            join = st_intersects,
                            left = FALSE)

  # ----------- 2. Identify which zones each trip passes by

  # ------ stop_times has all the stops visited by each trip. Join the stop geometry onto that data
  gtfs_trips_int <- left_join(gtfs$stop_times, gtfs_stops_int, by = "stop_id")

  # ----------- 3.  add info from frequencies.txt (start_time and headway_secs)
  gtfs_trips_int <- left_join(gtfs_trips_int, gtfs$frequencies, by = "trip_id")

  return(gtfs_trips_int)
}


# ---------- Function 2: Identify which OD pairs are served by each trip

# We have data on the zones served by each trip. We also know the order in which
# the zones are served (through the stop sequence). We use this information to get
# the OD pairs served by each trip. To obtain OD pairs, we need to respect the order
# in which zones are served. If a trip follows the itinerary: "zone1", "zone4", "zone8",
# then it serves

# zone1 : zone4
# zone1 : zone8
# zone4 : zone8

# It DOES NOT serve the return journeys (i.e. zone8 : zone4)



#' Function to generate valid pairs respecting original order
#'
#' This function is used to determine all OD pairs served directly by a trip
#' @param zones the row in a df with the zone_id
#'
#' @return a df with the following columns: trip_id, Origin, Destination. One row
#' for each valid OD pair + trip combination
#' @details We have data on the zones served by each trip. We also know the order in which
#' the zones are served (through the stop sequence). We use this information to get
#' the OD pairs served by each trip. To obtain OD pairs, we need to respect the order
