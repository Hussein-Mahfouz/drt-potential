#  This script proposes exploratory methods for answering the "PT vs DRT" question on a route-level   #
#  It builds on demand_no_direct_bus.R and visualises results overlayed with GTFS shapes              #
#  It also shows the overlap between bus routes and od demand:
#       To what extent does each demand pair overlap with existing bus routes (fraction of overlap)?  #
#       What is the headway of the buses that overlap?                                                #
